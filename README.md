# Python Trading App

**Python Trading App** is a modular and extensible Python framework designed for algorithmic trading, data-analysis and automation of trading workflows. It demonstrates my passion for bridging data science, automation and financial markets — a key asset for a Data & AI Solutions Intern role.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project showcases how to leverage Python for trading-related tasks including market data ingestion, scheduling, trade logic automation and reporting. It provides a foundation for integrating AI/data-driven decision making into trading operations, illustrating my ability to work at the intersection of data, AI and business value.

### Key Features

- Modular architecture: scripts such as `main.py`, `scheduler.py` and configuration files illustrate good separation of concerns.  
- Scheduled workflows: the `scheduler.py` enables periodic tasks (e.g., data refresh, trade evaluation) illustrating workflow automation.  
- Ticker management: `tickers.csv` enables management of instruments being tracked — demonstrating data-driven design.  
- PyProject/Poetry setup: `pyproject.toml` signals adoption of modern Python packaging and dependency management.  
- Clear separation of logic, scheduler, configuration 

## 🧠 Technical Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Project packaging:** Poetry / pyproject.toml  
- **Scheduling/Workflow automation:** via `scheduler.py`  
- **Data ingestion / ticker management:** via `tickers.csv`  
- **Modular scripting:** `main.py` as entry point  
- **Version control and continuous development:** project hosted on GitHub  

## 🔍 Why This Project Matters for Data & AI

In a Data & AI Solutions role, you’re often required to:  
- work with time-series and streaming data  
- automate workflows and pipelines  
- integrate models or intelligence into business-facing applications  
- present insights and deploy end-to-end solutions  

This project touches on all of those domains:  
- You see time-series (tickers/instruments) being managed,  
- Scheduling of jobs demonstrates pipeline automation,  
- The modular design allows future extension into data modelling / AI modules (e.g., signals, predictions, risk analytics),  
- And the end goal — trading automation — aligns with real-world business processes.  

## 📂 Getting Started
